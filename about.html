          <h5>FANTASTIC EVENT & <span>AMAZING</span></h5>
          <p>At the Instagram event in my school, I had the opportunity to watch a 
            variety of exciting activities that showcased the spirit and talent of our 
            community. The event kicked off with a vibrant opening salvo, filled with energetic
             performances of dance, cheers, and skits, setting an electric tone for the day. The cheer dance 
             teams wowed the audience with their synchronized routines and high-energy moves, 
             while the Mr. and Mrs. competition added a touch of glamour, with students competing gracefully for the titles.
              The sports events, featuring everything from track races to ball games, kept the excitement going, 
              highlighting the athleticism and teamwork of my schoolmates. Overall, the event was a thrilling celebration of talent, 
              creativity, and school pride.</p>
